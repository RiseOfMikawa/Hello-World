# Hello-World
0..0
Hi there!
I am a undergraduate student and my major is Material Science and Engineering.
I am learning to code.
I would be quite busy these months and might not have too much time for coding.
I do not have much experience on coding and have little understanding on C/C++.
Well...I guess the only thing matters is to keep learning and practising.

#include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
  cout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;
  return 0;
  }
  
  Have a nice day :D
